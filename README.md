### Blackjack Project

## Overview

Blackjack is a game of risk and probability, and this program has the foundational rules for one player to take on the Dealer in their pursuit of Blackjack!

Game Logic: Cards are dealt to Dealer(2 with one concealed) and Player(2) and again to Player until Stay/Bust, then play turns to the Dealer. If Dealer hand value is under 17, Dealer hits, and over 17, Dealer stays. Play continues until Stay/Bust and final hand values are displayed for Dealer and Player along with the winner of the hand. At any time if Dealer or Player Busts/Hits 21, the game is over. Enjoy!


# Technologies Used

* Java
* Enums
* Object-Oriented design
* Super and Sub classes
* Interfaces
* Abstract classes

## How to Run

This program can be run in Eclipse and will cycle through one game of Blackjack each time run is selected. The player will need to confirm they would like to start a new game to have cards dealt(Y), and the player will also need to decide if they want to hit(H) or stay(S) while the program handles all other game logic behind the scenes.

If desired, the parent classes are designed to act as foundation for any computable card game, be it poker or go fish. But Blackjack is the name of the game for today.

# Lessons Learned

This project was great practice at Object Oriented Programming. I was able to clarify understanding of how super and sub classes work as well as managing data and game logic in an OO manner. I am still working on keeping code DRY and creating the most efficient class hierarchy.
