###Blackjack Project
##Overview

Blackjack is a game of risk and probability, and this program has the foundational rules for one player to take on the Dealer in their pursuit of 21, or better yet, Blackjack!


#Technologies Used

* Java
* Enums
* Object-Oriented design
* Super and Sub classes
* Interfaces
* Abstract classes

##How to Run

This program can be run in Eclipse and will cycle through one game of Blackjack each time run is selected. The player will need to confirm they would like to start a new game to have cards dealt, and the player will also need to decide if they want to hit or stay while the program handles all Dealer logic behind the scenes.

#Lessons Learned

This project was great practice at Object Oriented Programming. I was able to solidify some of my understanding of how super and sub classes work as well as managing data and game logic.
